        <p><em>Founder of <b>Taiki NFT.</b></em></p>
        <p2>A self-assured, unreserved, and organised candidate who has yet to show off his technological skill and has the ability to communicate and collaborate with team members, clients and senior managers to achieve high goals and objectives. I
          am
          currently looking to build my professional career after completion of a 3-month Data migration internship at Ingage IR. I can build and manage dashboards, spreadsheets also advanced excel tables. <br> I can also build a website from scratch
          using
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript and love to experience change in a blank worksheet. Not to forget I have collaborated with clients to meet requirements and make sure everyone is on the same page. I am open to many opportunities, and I can achieve
          numerous objectives with others as well as individually.</p2>
